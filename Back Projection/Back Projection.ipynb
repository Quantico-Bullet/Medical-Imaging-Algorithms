    "# Back Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "`Back Projection` is a tomographic image reconstruction technique used to obtain an anatomical image from CT data (projections) by smearing the CT projections back onto an image at the angles they were acquired. The CT data is obtained by rotating the fan beam through an angle of $ 180^{\\circ} $ _(we only rotate through this angle because a complete $ 360^{\\circ} $ would be a duplication of data)_. As a result a point in the region being imaged must be included in all the projections.\n",

    "### The Radon Transform\n",
    "To think of this mathematically, we note that different organs/tissues in the body have different attenuation coefficients and that the attenuation is exponential, since the fan beam moves about an angle $ \\theta $ and collects the data at a distance $r$ _(from source to fan beam detector)_ we can write the following familiar equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle I = I_0 \\exp \\left(-\\int{\\mu(x,y)\\, ds}\\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence by simply rearranging the above equation we simply find that the total attenuation $ p_{\\theta}(r) $ for the angle $\\theta$  at some position $r$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle p_{\\theta}(r) = \\ln{\\left(\\frac{I}{I_0}\\right)} = -\\int \\mu(x,y) \\, ds$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using polar coordinates we obtain the following form (The Radon Transform):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\displaystyle p_{\\theta}(r) = -\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x,y)\\delta(x\\cos\\theta+y\\sin\\theta - r) \\, dxdy$\n",
